				{
					"question": "Who is Networky for?",
					"answer": "If you’re sick of Facebook Events, awkward group chats, and screenshotted flyers, Networky is perfect for you. Create your party page in seconds, with tons of customization options, a photo roll, and endless GIFs and memes to make your party memorable."
				},
				{
					"question": "Why use Networky?",
					"answer": "Networky streamlines the process of planning and communicating with guests. It’s great for when you don’t have everyone’s phone numbers or socials, like when you’re inviting friends-of-friends. You get a single link to share on any platform. Guests RSVP with their phone number, which lets them receive Text Blast updates from you as well as automatic reminders. Everyone who RSVPs can see who else is going (through a setting you control), increasing party attendance and building hype. Networky is also great for listed events (where you want to approve each guest), for parties when you need to ask questions of guests (e.g. dietary restrictions), and for when you need to collect money via Venmo or CashApp. Everyone can also share photos directly on the party page. Our mission is to help foster friendships through social events, so we also make it easy to connect with the people you’re meeting at parties. Add your socials and photo to your Networky profile so people can get in touch after each event."
				},
				{
					"question": "What types of events does Networky support?",
					"answer": "Anything from small dinner parties, to big weekend houseparties, to massive warehouse raves. Anytime you’re trying to coordinate with a group of people, Networky comes in handy. We support both regular RSVPs as well as listed events that require host approval of each guest."
				},
				{
					"question": "Where do Networky events happen?",
					"answer": "We have party people all over the world. Our company is HQ’ed in NYC, where we power thousands of parties every week. But anywhere parties happen, you can find Networky — throughout the U.S. and around the world. We support most international phone numbers, so whether you’re clubbing in Berlin, vibing in Sydney, raving in Rio, or celebrating in Seoul, Networky is there for you."
